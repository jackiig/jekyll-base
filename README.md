Now with 100% More Jekyll!

## This is a personal repo, I wouldn't recommend using it.

If you do decide to use this, however, what you'll find is a base
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
project which has a few base packages built in.  The most prominent
package included is the wonderful
[jekyll-assets](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-assets),
which acts very similar to the Rails asset pipeline.

I plan to keep this up to date with the latest
[Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/),
and
[jQuery 2.2](http://jquery.com/download/#jquery-2-x).

I'm not sure if I'll plan to fork this repo, or just download
the zip file and go from there.
